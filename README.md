# Todo App

Basic Todo App built using React+vanilla CSS. There have been several iterations of this project in the past but unfortunately mistakes were made by the past me, so although the tag - v1.0.0 exists, it is not not in state to be deployed to gh-pages . However, there are other live versions, be sure to checkout the links below:
